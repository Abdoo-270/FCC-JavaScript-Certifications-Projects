# FCC JavaScript Certifications Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the **freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification. Each project demonstrates the application of various JavaScript concepts and problem-solving techniques. Below is a brief overview of the projects included:

## Projects

1. **Palindrome Checker**
   - This project checks if a given string is a palindrome, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

2. **Roman Numeral Converter**
   - Converts a given integer into its corresponding Roman numeral representation.

3. **Caesar Cipher**
   - Implements the Caesar cipher, an encryption technique that shifts each letter in a string by a specified number of places in the alphabet.

4. **Phone Number Validator**
   - Validates whether a given string is a valid US phone number format.

5. **Cash Register**
   - Simulates a cash register that returns the correct change in the appropriate denominations.

## How to Run

Each project is contained within its own JavaScript file. To run a project, you can simply execute the corresponding file in a JavaScript environment (such as Node.js) or include the script in an HTML file.
